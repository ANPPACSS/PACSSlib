Positron Annihilation Coincidence Scanning System
PACSS

This repository contains the code used for analysis of data from the PACSS. The
library is based around the ROOT data analysis framework and has several classes that are convenient for storing data from the different detector systems.

The code herein is tested with ROOT 5.34.(04, 07) on Ubuntu 12.04 with ROOT installed in /usr/local/root. No guarantees or attempts are made with regards to it working in any other configuration!
